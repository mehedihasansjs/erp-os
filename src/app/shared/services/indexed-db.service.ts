/**
 * IndexedDB is a low-level API for client-side storage of significant amounts
 * of structured data, including files/blobs. This API uses indexes to enable high-performance
 * searches of this data. While Web Storage is useful for storing smaller amounts of data,
 * it is less useful for storing larger amounts of structured data. IndexedDB provides a solution.
 * 
 * This is the main landing page for MDN's IndexedDB coverage â€” here we provide links
 * to the full API reference and usage guides, browser support details,
 * and some explanation of key concepts.
